How can we detect plant diseases?
Image result for plant disease detection in ,ml
Diseased plants can be identified by abnormal growth or by signs of the disease-causing organism, such as bacterial slime (an external sign of a disease called bacterial wet wood) or insect larvae which hatches from eggs and feeds on leaves.
Your plants will let you know if they have a disease problem; growth slows, stunts or becomes spindly; leaves turn yellow, show white powdery blotches or develop spots. Infected leaves eventually drop. Plant stems may become soft and mushy, with black discoloration near the soil.
